# Simple TO-DO LIST by Abdilmujeeb under NOORLABS MENTORSHIP

This is a simple mini project that allows users to add tasks they aim to do onto a list for proper tracking and management.

## Description
This project demonstrates basic JavaScript features such as events,functions, DOM manipulation, etc. 

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS [especially useful in positioning the remove buttons in the list items]
- JavaScript

## Features
- Dynamic text input field.
- Simple and beginner-friendly design
- A simple instruction is also seen on the page to act as further help. This will especially be useful for visually impaired users using screen readers and other assistive technology.

## How It Works
1. Input field is focused on and task to do is typed in.
NB: An Empty task field won't run and will display an error message.
2. JavaScript listens for button click events via the event delegation feature.
3. On clicking the 'Add to List' button, the current input value of the text field is added to a dynamic list.
4. Already added items can be removed by clicking the remove button.
5. Clicking the remove button will prompt a confirmatory window and the item will only be deleted if 'OK' is clicked. This is to prevent unintentional deletions and user frustration.

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Then follow the instructions in 'HOW IT WORKS' above.
